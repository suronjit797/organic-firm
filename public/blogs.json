        "answer": "Context API is a feature of React that allows to share state across the entire app. The Context API is a React structure that enables to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of application. This is the alternative to 'prop drilling' or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is designed to share data that can be considered 'global' for a tree of React components. React.createContext() is returns a consumer and a provider.

Consumer as it so happens is a component that consumes and uses the state.",
